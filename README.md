# BestShop - simple webpage made with HTML and CSS

This is one of my first projects in HTML and CSS. I did it in December of 2019 during **Coderslab workshop** using only **HTML and CSS**.

## The project's main goal

It was my first website where I was delivered with AdobeXD / Figma project. I've learnt how to use this applications, and how to move graphic project into code and working website.

Also it was very good way to learn more about:

- lists;
- flex;
- before and after selectors;

## Sources

I got AdobeXD/Figma files with this template as a part of my Coderslab workshop, after finishing HTML/CSS part of the course.

## Installation

Just download all the files, and open index.html
